# JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic features on websites. It was initially developed as a client-side scripting language, but over time it has expanded its reach to server-side programming and other environments.

JavaScript allows developers to add functionality to web pages by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure and content of a webpage. With JavaScript, you can control various aspects of a webpage, such as modifying HTML elements, handling events, validating user input, and making requests to servers for data exchange.

Here are some key features and concepts related to JavaScript:
- `Syntax` : JavaScript has a C-like syntax, which is relatively easy to learn and understand. It uses variables, data types, operators, control structures (like if statements and loops), functions, and objects to express program logic.
- `Client-Side Scripting` : JavaScript is primarily executed on the client-side, meaning it runs in the user's web browser. This allows for dynamic interactions and real-time updates without requiring a page reload.
- `DOM Manipulation` : JavaScript can access and modify elements, attributes, and styles of a webpage using the DOM API. This enables developers to create interactive user interfaces and respond to user actions.
- `Event Handling` : JavaScript enables the handling of various events triggered by user actions (e.g., button clicks, mouse movements, keyboard input). You can define event listeners that execute specific code when an event occurs.
- `Asynchronous Programming` : JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through techniques like callbacks, Promises, and async/await. This allows for non-blocking operations such as fetching data from servers or performing time-consuming tasks without freezing the user interface.
- `Server-Side Development` : With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side development. It allows developers to build server applications and handle network requests, interact with databases, and perform other server-side tasks.
- `Libraries and Frameworks` : JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that extend its capabilities and provide additional functionalities. Examples include React, Angular, Vue.js for front-end development, and Express.js, Nest.js for back-end development.

JavaScript has become an essential part of web development due to its versatility and wide browser support. It enables the creation of interactive web applications, games, mobile apps (using frameworks like React Native), and even desktop applications (using frameworks like Electron).

It's worth noting that JavaScript is distinct from Java, despite the similar name. They are separate programming languages with different syntax, use cases, and underlying technologies.

well.. <br />
i've just made simple calculator, sadly it still have bugs :') <br />
and i made simple weather app <br />
